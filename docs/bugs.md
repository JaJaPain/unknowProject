### Autopilot object avoidance regressed
**Spotted:** ~2026-06-21  
**Severity:** Medium — ship flies into stations and asteroids during autopilot  
**Root cause identified:** `_get_autopilot_avoidance()` (`PlayerShip.gd:999`) is fully implemented but is **never called** from the main autopilot movement block (`PlayerShip.gd:740–754`). The movement loop only calls `_route_steer_target()` (static A* planner). The real-time avoidance system exists but got disconnected from the autopilot loop, likely when the planner was introduced.

**Fix plan:**
Two complementary layers need to work together:
1. **Static planner** (`_route_steer_target`) — runs A* at route-start to generate waypoints around known hazards. Good for long-distance routing.
2. **Real-time avoidance** (`_get_autopilot_avoidance`) — scans for obstacles along the current heading every frame. Acts as a forward whisker/feeler (the Unity "empty object on the ship nose" equivalent). Needs to be called every frame in the autopilot block and its `steer_target` fed into `steer_towards()` in place of the planner's output when avoidance is active.

**Wire-up:** In `_physics_process`, after getting `steer_target` from `_route_steer_target`, pass it through `_get_autopilot_avoidance(steer_target, active_target)`. If `is_avoiding` is true, use avoidance's `steer_target` instead. This gives the planner the big picture and the whisker handles surprises.

**Additionally:** Add a `RayCast3D` on the ship nose for imminent collision (distance < 30u) that forces `_clear_planned_route()` immediately, triggering a fresh A* replan without waiting for the 2.5s stall timer.

**Where to change:** `scripts/PlayerShip.gd:740–754` (autopilot movement block).

### Agent accept reply uses Kaelen voice
**Spotted:** 2026-06-23  
**Severity:** Medium — breaks immersion every time a quest is accepted  
**Description:** After the player accepts a quest from an agent (Liaison Ryn, Director Voss, etc.), the agent's spoken reply uses Kaelen's voice instead of the agent's own voice blend.  
**Where to look:** `UIManager.gd` or `SpeechService` — wherever the post-accept dialogue TTS call is made. Check that the agent's voice blend is passed, not defaulting to the Kaelen blend.

### Quest tracker panel blue box reappears on second quest
**Spotted:** 2026-06-25  
**Severity:** Low — cosmetic  
**Description:** When the player accepts a second quest, the oversized empty blue box (quest tracker panel) reappears. The `call_deferred("reset_size")` fix only fires when the panel first becomes visible; it doesn't re-fire when a new quest loads into an already-visible panel.  
**Where to look:** `scripts/UIManager.gd` → `_update_quest_tracker()`. The `reset_size()` call needs to fire every time quest content changes. Also check if `user://ui_layout.json` is persisting a saved `w`/`h` for the quest panel and re-applying it on each update.

### Mechanic pickup prompt persists after quest delivery
**Spotted:** 2026-06-25  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** After the player delivers a special cargo item to the mechanic NPC and receives credits, the "I'll Grab It / Not Now" buttons still show on subsequent visits. They should disappear permanently once the pickup quest is complete.  
**Where to look:** `scripts/UIManager.gd` — wherever the mechanic dock panel is built/refreshed. The prompt visibility is likely gated on a quest state flag that isn't being cleared after completion. Check `QuestManager` or `GlobalState` for the relevant completion flag.
